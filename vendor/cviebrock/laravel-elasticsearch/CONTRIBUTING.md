# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via pull requests via 
[Github](https://github.com/cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch).

1. Fork the project.
2. Create your bugfix/feature branch and write your (well-commented) code.
3. Create unit tests for your code:
	- Run `composer install --dev` in the root directory to install required testing packages.
	- Add your test classes/methods to the `/tests/` directory.
	- Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` and make sure everything passes (new and old tests).
3. Commit your changes (and your tests) and push to your branch.
4. Create a new pull request against this package's `master` branch.


## Pull Requests

- **Use the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).**
  The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!**  Your pull request won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour.**  Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant 
  documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle.**  We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). 
  Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches.**  Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature.**  If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history.** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. 
  If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please 
  [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.

- Don't worry about updating `CHANGELOG.md` or `.semver`.  The package administrator
  will handle updating those when new releases are created.
  

**Thank you!**
